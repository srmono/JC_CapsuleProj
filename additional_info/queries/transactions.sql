 Let's learn 
 MySQL transaction and 
 how to use the COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements to manage transactions in MySQL.
 
 Introducing to MySQL transactions
 To understand what a transaction in MySQL is, let’s take a look at an example of adding a new sales order in our sample database. The steps of adding a sales order are as described as follows:
 
 - First, query the latest sales order number from the orders table and use the next sales order number as the new sales order number.
 - Next, insert a new sales order into the orders table.
 - Then, get the newly inserted sales order number
 - After that, insert the new sales order items into the orderdetails table with the sales order number
 - Finally, select data from both orders and orderdetails tables to confirm the changes
 
 Now, imagine what would happen to the sales order data if one or more steps above fail due to some reasons such as table locking? For example, if the step of adding order’s items into orderdetails table fails, you will have an empty sales order.
 
 That is why the transaction processing comes to the rescue. 
 MySQL transaction allows you to execute a set of MySQL operations 
 to ensure that the database never contains the result of partial operations. 
 In a set of operations, if one of them fails, the rollback occurs to restore 
 the database to its original state. If no error occurs, 
 the entire set of statements is committed to the database

 MySQL transaction statements
 
 MySQL provides us with the following important statement to control transactions:
 
 - To start a transaction, you use the START TRANSACTION  statement. The BEGIN or  BEGIN WORK are the aliases of the START TRANSACTION.
 - To commit the current transaction and make its changes permanent,  you use the COMMIT statement.
 - To roll back the current transaction and cancel its changes, you use the ROLLBACK statement.
 - To disable or enable the auto-commit mode for the current transaction, you use the SET autocommit statement.
 
 By default, MySQL automatically commits the changes permanently to the database. 
 To force MySQL not to commit changes automatically, you use the following statement:
 
 SET autocommit = 0;
 Or
 SET autocommit = OFF
 
 ----
 You use the following statement to enable the autocommit mode explicitly:
 
 SET autocommit = 1;
 Or
 SET autocommit = ON;

-- Use the  orders and orderDetails
/*
 COMMIT practice 
 
 In order to use a transaction, 
 you first have to break the SQL statements into logical portions 
 and determine when data should be committed or rolled back.
 
 - First, start a transaction by using the START TRANSACTION  statement.
 - Next, select the latest sales order number from the orders table and use the next sales order number as the new sales order number.
 - Then, insert a new sales order into the orders table.
 - After that, insert sales order items into the orderdetails table.
 - Finally, commit the transaction using the COMMIT statement
 
 Optionally, you can select data from both orders and orderdetails tables to check the new sales order.
