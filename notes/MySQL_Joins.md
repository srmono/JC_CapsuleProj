You're absolutely right! Providing the schema before explaining the joins makes the explanation clearer and helps avoid confusion. The schema gives context to the examples and helps visualize the relationships between the tables.

Let me revise the explanation by including a schema first:

---

### **Example Schema**

We'll use the following tables for our examples:

1. **Employees Table**:
   | ID  | Name     | Dept_ID |
   |------|----------|---------|
   | 1    | Alice    | 101     |
   | 2    | Bob      | 102     |
   | 3    | Charlie  | NULL    |

2. **Departments Table**:
   | ID   | Name        |
   |------|-------------|
   | 101  | HR          |
   | 102  | IT          |
   | 103  | Finance     |

### **Explanation of Joins**

With this schema in mind, here’s how the various joins work:

#### 1. **INNER JOIN**
- Combines rows from both tables where `Dept_ID` in `Employees` matches `ID` in `Departments`.

```sql
SELECT employees.ID, employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.Dept_ID = departments.ID;
```

**Result**:
| ID  | Employee | Department |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | Alice    | HR         |
| 2   | Bob      | IT         |

---

#### 2. **LEFT JOIN**
- Returns all rows from `Employees`, and matches from `Departments`. Unmatched rows in `Departments` have `NULL` values.

```sql
SELECT employees.ID, employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.Dept_ID = departments.ID;
```

**Result**:
| ID  | Employee | Department |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | Alice    | HR         |
| 2   | Bob      | IT         |
| 3   | Charlie  | NULL       |

---

#### 3. **RIGHT JOIN**
- Returns all rows from `Departments`, and matches from `Employees`. Unmatched rows in `Employees` have `NULL` values.

```sql
SELECT employees.ID, employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.Dept_ID = departments.ID;
```

**Result**:
| ID  | Employee | Department |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | Alice    | HR         |
| 2   | Bob      | IT         |
| NULL| NULL     | Finance    |

---

#### 4. **FULL JOIN**
- Combines all rows from both tables, showing `NULL` where there’s no match.

```sql
SELECT employees.ID, employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.Dept_ID = departments.ID
UNION
SELECT employees.ID, employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.Dept_ID = departments.ID;
```

**Result**:
| ID  | Employee | Department |
|-----|----------|------------|
| 1   | Alice    | HR         |
| 2   | Bob      | IT         |
| 3   | Charlie  | NULL       |
| NULL| NULL     | Finance    |

---

#### 5. **CROSS JOIN**
- Produces the Cartesian product (every combination of rows from both tables).

```sql
SELECT employees.Name AS Employee, departments.Name AS Department
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

**Result**:
| Employee  | Department |
|-----------|------------|
| Alice     | HR         |
| Alice     | IT         |
| Alice     | Finance    |
| Bob       | HR         |
| Bob       | IT         |
| Bob       | Finance    |
| Charlie   | HR         |
| Charlie   | IT         |
| Charlie   | Finance    |

---

#### 6. **SELF JOIN**
- Used when a table references itself, such as an employee-manager relationship.

```sql
SELECT E1.Name AS Employee, E2.Name AS Manager
FROM employees E1
INNER JOIN employees E2
ON E1.Dept_ID = E2.ID;
```

---

### **Why the Schema Matters**
Introducing the schema at the start clarifies:
1. What columns are available.
2. How tables relate to each other.
3. The context for why certain rows are included or excluded in the join results.

The **joins supported by MySQL** and the ones that are **not supported**:

| **Join Type**           | **Supported in MySQL** | **Notes**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **INNER JOIN**           | ✅ Yes                 | Returns matching rows from both tables.                                                    |
| **LEFT JOIN**            | ✅ Yes                 | Also known as LEFT OUTER JOIN. Includes all rows from the left table, even if no match.     |
| **RIGHT JOIN**           | ✅ Yes                 | Also known as RIGHT OUTER JOIN. Includes all rows from the right table, even if no match.   |
| **FULL OUTER JOIN**      | ❌ No                  | Not natively supported, but can be simulated using `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. |
| **CROSS JOIN**           | ✅ Yes                 | Produces the Cartesian product of the two tables.                                           |
| **SELF JOIN**            | ✅ Yes                 | Achieved by joining a table with itself using table aliases.                                |

### **Details on Unsupported Joins**
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: 
  - MySQL does not natively support this.
  - Can be simulated using a combination of `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `UNION`:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    LEFT JOIN table2
    ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column
    UNION
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    RIGHT JOIN table2
    ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
    ```
