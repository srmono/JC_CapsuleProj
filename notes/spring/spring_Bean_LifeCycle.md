In Spring Framework, the **Bean Lifecycle** refers to the various stages a Spring Bean goes through from creation to destruction. Here is a breakdown of the bean lifecycle steps in a Spring Boot application:

### 1. **Instantiation**:
   - Spring container creates the bean by calling the constructor (either default or parameterized) using reflection.

### 2. **Populate Properties**:
   - After instantiation, Spring injects dependencies into the bean (if any) via **Dependency Injection**. These dependencies are set either through the **setter methods** or **constructor injection**.

### 3. **Bean Initialization**:
   - If the bean implements `InitializingBean` interface, Spring will invoke the `afterPropertiesSet()` method. 
   - Additionally, if there's any custom initialization method defined using `@PostConstruct` or XML configuration, it will be called.

### 4. **Bean Ready to Use**:
   - After initialization, the bean is now fully configured and ready for use by the application.

### 5. **Destruction**:
   - When the Spring container is shut down or when the bean is no longer in use, Spring will invoke the **destruction callback**. This can be done either by implementing the `DisposableBean` interface or using the `@PreDestroy` annotation.

### Key Points:
1. **Instantiation**: The Spring container creates a bean from the bean definition.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Spring injects the necessary dependencies into the bean.
3. **Initialization**: The bean can perform some custom initialization logic.
4. **Ready to Use**: The bean is now fully initialized and can be used.
5. **Destruction**: When the bean is no longer needed, it gets destroyed by invoking the appropriate method.
